# STRUCTURE

Each plugin should be in its own folder, and that folder should have the same name as the `.sp` file you wish to be compiled (without the file extension).

- ## your_plugins/
  
  - ##### plugin_a/
    
    - plugin_a.sp
    
    - include/
      
      - some_include.inc
  
  - ##### releases/
    
    - plugin_a_v<version>
      
      - scripting/
        
        - include/
          
          - some_include.inc
        
        - plugin_a.sp
      
      - plugins/
        
        - plugin_a.smx

**note**: the releases directory should not exist initially - it will be generated by the script.
